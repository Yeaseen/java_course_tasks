## Java Basic Programming

Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language. Here, we cover the basics, including syntax, operators, data types, and control flow. This section is perfect for beginners or those looking to refresh their knowledge.

- **Syntax and Structure:** The foundation of writing in Java.
- **Operators:** Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.
- **Control Flow:** If-else statements, loops, and switch cases.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

- **Classes and Objects:** The basics of defining classes and creating objects.
- **Inheritance:** How to use inheritance to promote code reuse and establish a subclass-superclass relationship.
- **Encapsulation:** The importance of encapsulating data and methods within classes to protect the integrity of the object.
- **Polymorphism:** Utilizing polymorphism to allow methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

## Java Packages

Packages in Java are used to group related classes and interfaces. This section explores how to create and use packages to organize your code effectively.

- **Creating Packages:** Best practices for package naming and structure.
- **Using Packages:** How to import and utilize packages in your Java applications.

## MVC Pattern

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a software design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components. This section delves into each component and how they interact within Java applications.

- **Model:** Manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
- **View:** Any representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram.
- **Controller:** Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

## Java Collections

The Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating groups of data as a single unit. This section covers the core interfaces and implementations.

- **Linked List, Set, Map:** Understanding the primary collection types.
- **Performance Considerations:** Best practices for using collections efficiently.

## Factory Design Pattern Game

A GUI-less simple game based on Factory Design Pattern.

## Projects Using Java Swing

Java Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. This section showcases projects that utilize Swing to create interactive desktop applications.

The project covers following:

- A GUI for the users
- Opening a txt file from the File Explorer and Contents will be shown with line numbers
- Sort based on user's direction
