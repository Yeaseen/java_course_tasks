Use linked lists to store and sort words
Create a class called WordList based on the linked list with head node as shown in lecture. The
data in the nodes should be a String.
Create a class called UnsortedWordList that extends WordList. It should have an append
method.
Create a class called SortedWordList that extends WordList. It should have a method called add
which takes a String as a parameter and inserts that word into the list in a position so that the
list remains sorted.
Read from the file and add to the sorted list
